      It’s impossible to find a band that have grown so much in such a short
      amount of time as Cub Sport.Over the last eight years, the Brisbane-based
      outfit - Tim Nelson, Zoe Davis, Sam Netterfield and Dan Puusaari - have
      blossomed from a band on the cusp of Australia’s indie-pop explosion to
      otherworldly cult favourites; their sound and image changing as the group
      grow from a bunch of teenagers making pop music to something much more
      than that.
      <br /><br />
      Through their discography, you can feel how Cub Sport have grown, both as
      musicians and personally speaking too. Their earliest work felt like
      quirky indie-pop much alike fellow Brisbane break-outs The Jungle Giants,
      and the group - rather fresh-faced, back then - seemingly blended into the
      crowd. BATS saw the group started to shift.
      <br /><br />
      First came love (and second came marriage, you know the rest), with the
      band’s Tim Nelson becoming engaged to keyboardist Sam Netterfield. BATS,
      at its core, depicted the processes of acceptance and assurance that lead
      to it all happening, and thus began Cub Sport’s transition into a unique,
      defiant addition to Australian music that thrives on authenticity and
      queerness (of three of its members, also including Zoe Davis, and in its
      fans too)
