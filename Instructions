Band Challenge
Create a website about a band that you like using HTML

Elements that should be included:

A homepage, featuring photo of the band and a brief description (How they started, genre, controversy etc)

A discography page, showing their latest 3 studio albums in order of release, with an album cover and track listing

A bio page showing an unordered list of band members, with a photo, name, instrument for each

A navbar with links to the 3 pages

Heading on each page, telling the user which page they are on. Homepage should have title of the band.

A footer with your copyright (make sure to use the copyright symbol)

Throughout the site, try using HTML elements for effect! (e.g. <em> <strong> etc)

Also use semantic HTML tags where possible

Note: For this challenge, we haven't written tests, because there are a lot of different ways to get the result we are looking for - any test we wrote would check some of those techniques, but might mark you incorrect if you found a good way to do it that we didn't think of!

To know if you've got it right, just take a look at your page and decide for yourself - does it look like our description above? If so, congratulations, you nailed it! If not, keep trying, and don't forget to come ask for help if you get stuck. :)
